# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Homework

Analysis: Minimal data cleansing was required before testing; no null values in dataset
Histogram shows positive trend

Logistic Regression Model: Presents higher level of accuracy

Random Forest Classifier: When reviewing training/testing scoresl not a huge different between both models.

Summary: Both models show positive trends; Logistic Regression Model performed better than Random Forest Classifier
